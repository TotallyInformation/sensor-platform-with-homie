# sensor-platform-with-homie
C++ code for the Arduino IDE for use on ESP8266 wi-fi connected microprocessors. 

Uses Homie as a base allowing configuration via a json file (see /data/sample-config.json). 
The code includes a range of standard and common sensors that might be used for home automation.
